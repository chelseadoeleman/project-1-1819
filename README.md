## OBA API


## Concept 

For this concept I will solely focus on Oba Junior. To make searching books easier for them I want to create an application where they can visually choose what preferences they have for a book, or what they are looking for. This will then be connected to their personal data, where their history also can be found. This dataset however is not publicaly available yet so I will have to fake this data. 

After this process the user will be able to scan a book and get a selections of books based on their previous reading history or based on some genre's they have read before to discover new books. Then the application will tell them where they can find this book, by showing a floor plan of the junior department and highlighting that specific book case. If they have a mobile phone they can scan the floorplan using a QR code, to view the floor plan on their mobile phone.
